# [Project 1 :Voice Based Gender Identification Using Machine Learning:](https://github.com/ItapuAbhishek/PRoject1.git)
## Project Overview:
* The project is aimed at analyzing the effectiveness and performance of different machine learning Algorithms in its ability to identify gender based on the acoustic properties
* There are only two categories men or women to predict it is treated as Binary Classification Problem
* The project evaluates Generalization and predictive performance of all the models on the future data and based on results we find the best suited method.
