# [Project 1 :Voice Based Gender Identification Using Machine Learning:](https://github.com/ItapuAbhishek/Voice-Based-Gender-Recognition-using-Machine-learning.git)

## Project Overview:
* The project is aimed at analyzing the effectiveness and performance of different machine learning Algorithms in its ability to identify voice as male or female, based upon on the acoustic properties
* scraped over 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers.
* The Problem falls under supervised learning as the system is trained by providing large number of labelled inputs for both genders.Also,it is a classification problem as the output is based on classification into male or female.
* The project evaluates Generalization and predictive performance of all the models on the future data and based on results we find the best suited method.
*XGBOOST gave the best accuracy Score and i proceeded with hypertuning using Gridsearch cv and was able to achieve 97% accuracy

# [Project 1 :Segmenting Credit Card Customers with Machine Learning:](https://github.com/ItapuAbhishek/Segmenting-Credit-Card-Customers-with-Machine-Learning.git)

## Project Overview:
*The aim of this project requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. 
*The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders with 18 behavior variables during the last 6 months. 
* This study also aims to see different Machine Learning Methods on the same data set.
