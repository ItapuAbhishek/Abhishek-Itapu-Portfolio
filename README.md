# [Project 1 :Voice Based Gender Identification Using Machine Learning:]  (https://github.com/ItapuAbhishek/Voice-Based-Gender-Recognition-using-Machine-learning.git)

## Project Overview:
* The project is aimed at analyzing the effectiveness and performance of different machine learning Algorithms in its ability to identify voice as male or female, based upon on the acoustic properties
* scraped over 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers.
* There are only two categories men or women to predict it is treated as Binary Classification Problem
* The project evaluates Generalization and predictive performance of all the models on the future data and based on results we find the best suited method.
